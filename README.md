In this project, I wanted to create a unique visual effect using an image of MF Doom and his lyrics. My idea was to have the lyrics fill in the darker areas of the image while allowing the text to flow over time, creating a dynamic feel.

I started by loading MF Doom’s image and his lyrics file. The image mainly helps determine which areas are suitable for displaying lyrics, while the lyrics themselves are split into individual words to be displayed one by one. To enhance the visual effect, I also set a random rotation angle for each word, so they appear with subtle variations on the canvas, giving a more lively feel.

In the draw function, I go through the pixel areas of the image, checking pixel brightness at intervals. For any pixel with brightness below a certain value (a darker area), I display a word from the lyrics at that position. I use the red channel value to check pixel brightness, only showing text in the darker areas to preserve the overall shape of the image. The size of each word changes periodically over time, making the text feel as if it’s "breathing." Combined with the random rotation, each word displays at a unique angle and size, adding vibrancy and energy to the entire visual.
